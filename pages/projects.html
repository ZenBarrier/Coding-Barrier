                    A Chrome extension that uses jQuery to manipulate DOM 
                    on Facebook.com to blur selected people's posts and comments. 
                    The AngularJS framework was used to create a 
                    dynamic extension popup page and Bootstrap was used 
                    to quickly and easily design a user friendly interface. (2015)

                    Successfully developed an Android Wear app that is meant 
                    to inform users if their smart watch has completed charging. 
                    Developing this app has given me experience working 
                    with Android Studio and java, 
                    launching an app into the Google Play Store, and 
                    the basics of creating a mobile and wearable app.
